<td>Verify the file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands match the vendor values.

Check the default file permissions, ownership, and group membership of system files and commands with the following command:

# for i in `rpm -Va | egrep -i '^\.[M|U|G|.]{8}' | cut -d " " -f4,5`;do for j in `rpm -qf $i`;do rpm -ql $j --dump | cut -d " " -f1,5,6,7 | grep $i;done;done

/var/log/gdm 040755 root root
/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf 0100640 root root
/usr/bin/passwd 0104755 root root

For each file returned, verify the current permissions, ownership, and group membership:
# ls -la &lt;filename&gt;

-rw-------. 1 root root 133 Jan 11 13:25 /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf

If the file is more permissive than the default permissions, this is a finding.

If the file is not owned by the default owner and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

If the file is not a member of the default group and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.</td>
<td>Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:

# rpm -qf &lt;filename&gt;

Reset the user and group ownership of files within a package with the following command:

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash.</td>
<td>Verify the cryptographic hash of system files and commands match the vendor values.

Check the cryptographic hash of system files and commands with the following command:

Note: System configuration files (indicated by a "c" in the second column) are expected to change over time. Unusual modifications should be investigated through the system audit log.

# rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'

If there is any output from the command for system files or binaries, this is a finding.</td>

<td>Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by installing the dracut-fips package.

To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.

Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by following the steps below: 

The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should also ensure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.

Install the dracut-fips package with the following command:

# yum install dracut-fips

Recreate the "initramfs" file with the following command:

Note: This command will overwrite the existing "initramfs" file.

# dracut -f

Modify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the "grub.cfg" file by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the "/etc/default/grub" file and then rebuild the "grub.cfg" file:

fips=1

Changes to "/etc/default/grub" require rebuilding the "grub.cfg" file as follows:

On BIOS-based machines, use the following command:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

On UEFI-based machines, use the following command:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

If /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter boot=&lt;partition of /boot or /boot/efi&gt; must be added to the kernel command line. You can identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi command:

# df /boot
Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot

To ensure the "boot=" configuration option will work even if device naming changes occur between boots, identify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the partition with the following command:

# blkid /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: UUID="05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797" TYPE="ext4"

For the example above, append the following string to the kernel command line:

boot=UUID=05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797

<td>Ask the SA or ISSO if a host-based intrusion detection application is loaded on the system. Per OPORD 16-0080, the preferred intrusion detection system is McAfee HBSS available through the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).

If another host-based intrusion detection application is in use, such as SELinux, this must be documented and approved by the local Authorizing Official.

Procedure:
Examine the system to determine if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is installed:

# rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm

Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system:

# ps -ef | grep -i “hipclient”

If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion detection system:

# find / -name &lt;daemon name&gt;

Where &lt;daemon name&gt; is the name of the primary application daemon to determine if the application is loaded on the system.

Determine if the application is active on the system:

# ps -ef | grep -i &lt;daemon name&gt;

If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding.

If no host-based intrusion detection system is installed and running on the system, this is a finding.</td>
<td>Install and enable the latest McAfee HIPS package, available from USCYBERCOM.

Note: If the system does not support the McAfee HIPS package, install and enable a supported intrusion detection system application and document its use with the Authorizing Official.</td>

<td>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must be configured so that the x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence is disabled in the Graphical User Interface.</td>
<td>A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.</td>
<td>Note: If the operating system does not have a graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Verify the operating system is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed.

Check that the ctrl-alt-del.target is masked and not active in the graphical user interface with the following command:

# grep logout /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*

logout=''

If "logout" is not set to use two single quotations, or is missing, this is a finding.</td>
<td>Configure the system to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence for the graphical user interface with the following command:

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-disable-CAD 

Add the setting to disable the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence for the graphical user interface:

[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys]

<td>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system must disable the graphical user interface automounter unless required.</td>

<td>Verify the operating system disables the ability to automount devices in a graphical user interface.

Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used.

Check to see if automounter service is disabled with the following commands:
# cat /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-No-Automount

[org/gnome/desktop/media-handling]

automount=false

automount-open=false

autorun-never=true

If the output does not match the example above, this is a finding.

# cat /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-No-Automount

/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount

/org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount-open
