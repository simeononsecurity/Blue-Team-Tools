<td>Automated file system mounting tools must not be enabled unless needed.</td>
<td>All filesystems that are required for the successful operation of the system should be explicitly listed in "/etc/fstab" by an administrator. New filesystems should not be arbitrarily introduced via the automounter.

The "autofs" daemon mounts and unmounts filesystems, such as user home directories shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to handle removable media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device as "/misc/cd". However, this method of providing access to removable media is not common, so autofs can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is required, it is almost always possible to configure filesystem mounts statically by editing "/etc/fstab" rather than relying on the automounter. </td>
<td>To verify the "autofs" service is disabled, run the following command: 

chkconfig --list autofs

If properly configured, the output should be the following: 

autofs 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off

Verify the "autofs" service is not running:

# service autofs status

If the autofs service is enabled or running, this is a finding.</td>
<td>If the "autofs" service is not needed to dynamically mount NFS filesystems or removable media, disable the service for all runlevels: 

# chkconfig --level 0123456 autofs off

Stop the service if it is already running: 

# service autofs stop</td>

<td>Auditing must be enabled at boot by setting a kernel parameter.</td>
<td>Each process on the system carries an "auditable" flag which indicates whether its activities can be audited. Although "auditd" takes care of enabling this for all processes which launch after it does, adding the kernel argument ensures it is set for every process during boot.</td>
<td>Inspect the kernel boot arguments (which follow the word "kernel") in "/boot/grub/grub.conf". If they include "audit=1", then auditing is enabled at boot time.

If auditing is not enabled at boot time, this is a finding.

If the system uses UEFI inspect the kernel boot arguments (which follow the word "kernel") in “/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.conf”. If they include "audit=1", then auditing is enabled at boot time.</td>
<td>To ensure all processes can be audited, even those which start prior to the audit daemon, add the argument "audit=1" to the kernel line in "/boot/grub/grub.conf" or “/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.conf”, in the manner below:

kernel /vmlinuz-version ro vga=ext root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet audit=1

UEFI systems may prepend "/boot" to the "/vmlinuz-version" argument.</td>

<td>The system must provide automated support for account management functions.</td>

Enterprise environments make user account management challenging and complex. A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.</td>
<td>Interview the SA to determine if there is an automated system for managing user accounts, preferably integrated with an existing enterprise user management system.

If there is not, this is a finding.</td>
<td>Implement an automated system for managing user accounts that minimizes the risk of errors, either intentional or deliberate.  If possible, this system should integrate with an existing enterprise user management system, such as, one based Active Directory or Kerberos.</td>

<td>If IPv6 is disabled, this is not applicable.

Inspect the file "/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables" to determine the default policy for the INPUT chain. It should be set to DROP:

# grep ":INPUT" /etc/sysconfig/ip6tables

For manual installations, select the "Encrypt" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots. 

For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the "--encrypted" and "--passphrase=" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition: 

part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]

Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the "--passphrase=" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation. 

Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on the Red Hat Documentation web site:

For manual installations, select the "Encrypt" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots. 

For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the "--encrypted" and "--passphrase=" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition: 

part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]

Any [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the "--passphrase=" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

<td>The audit system must be configured to audit all attempts to alter system time through adjtimex.</td>
<td>Arbitrary changes to the system time can be used to obfuscate nefarious activities in log files, as well as to confuse network services that are highly dependent upon an accurate system time (such as sshd). All changes to the system time should be audited.</td>
<td>To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the "adjtimex" system call, run the following command:

$ sudo grep -w "adjtimex" /etc/audit/audit.rules

If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line. 

If the system is not configured to audit time changes, this is a finding.
