<td>Set Account Expiration Following Inactivity</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not
have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers
who may have compromised their credentials.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify the number of days after a password expires (which
signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct
the following lines in <code>/etc/default/useradd</code>, substituting
<code><i>NUM_DAYS</i></code> appropriately:
<pre>INACTIVE=<i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></pre>
A value of 35 is recommended; however, this profile expects that the value is set to
<code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.
If a password is currently on the
verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95
days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the
<code>useradd</code> man page for more information.  Determining the inactivity
timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal"
period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting
the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact
availability of the system to legitimate users.</td>

Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended,
negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating

Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or

To implement a weekly execution of AIDE at 4:05am using cron, add the following line to <code>/etc/crontab</code>:

<td>Set PAM's Password Hashing Algorithm</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can
be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that
are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are
kepy in plain text.
<br><br>
This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are
configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
Additionally, the <code>crypt_style</code> configuration option ensures the use
of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more
difficult.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted
representations of passwords. In <code>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</code>, the
<code>password</code> section of the file controls which PAM modules execute
during a password change. Set the <code>pam_unix.so</code> module in the
<code>password</code> section to include the argument <code>sha512</code>, as shown
below:
<br>
<pre>password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 <i>other arguments...</i></pre>
<br>
This will help ensure when local users change their passwords, hashes for
the new passwords will be generated using the SHA-512 algorithm. This is
the default.</td>
